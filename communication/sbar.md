# SBAR

**SBAR** stands for **S**ituation, **B**ackground, **A**ssessment and **R**ecommendation. 

> It's  a technique that can be used to facilitate prompt and appropriate communication. This communication model has gained popularity in healthcare settings, especially amongst professions such as physicians and nursing.

I use the SBAR technique when I need to hand-off my work to a team member or when I need an external member to make a decision to move forward.

### Example

* **Scenario**: Some user images are missing
* **Background**: The user uploaded certain images and are not displaying properly to them
* **Assessment**: The images that were missing are of heic format, jpgs and gifs display properly. The UI code does not hard-code file formats.
* **Recommendation**: The proper solution is to convert images on the server to a supported format. The fastest solution is to add a UI check for supported image formats.

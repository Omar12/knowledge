# Five Ways To Maximize Your Cognitive Potential

### Seek Novelty

**Always look to new activities to engage your mind—expand your cognitive horizons. Learn an instrument. Take an art class. Go to a museum. Read about a new area of science. Be a knowledge junkie.**

When you seek novelty, you are creating new synaptic connections with every new activity you engage in. These connections build on each other, increasing your neural activity, creating more connections to build on other connections—learning is taking place.

Constantly exposing yourself to new things helps puts your brain in a primed state for learning.

Novelty triggers dopamine, which not only kicks motivation into high gear, but it stimulates the creation of new neurons—and prepares your brain for learning.

### Challenge Yourself

In order to keep your brain making new connections and keeping them active, you need to keep moving on to another challenging activity _as soon as you reach the point of mastery_ in the one you are engaging in. You want to be in a constant state of slight discomfort, struggling to barely achieve whatever it is you are trying to do

Efficiency is **not** your friend when it comes to cognitive growth. 

### Think Creatively

Creative cognition involves divergent thinking \(a wide range of topics/subjects\), making remote associations between ideas, switching back and forth between conventional and unconventional thinking \(cognitive flexibility\), and generating original, novel ideas that are also appropriate to the activity you are doing.

### Do Things The Hard Way

Efficiency is not your friend if you are trying to increase your intelligence. Unfortunately, many things in life are centered on trying to make everything more efficient.

### Network

By exposing yourself to new people, ideas, and environments, you are opening yourself up to new opportunities for cognitive growth. Being in the presence of other people who may be outside of your immediate field gives you opportunities to see problems from a new perspective, or offer insight in ways that you had never thought of before. Learning is all about exposing yourself to new things and taking in that information in ways that are meaningful and unique—networking with other people is a great way to make that happen.

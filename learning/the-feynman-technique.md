# The Feynman Technique

### **1. Identify the subject**

Grab a sheet of paper and **write the name of the concept** at the top. Write down everything you know about the topic. Each time you run into new sources of information, add them to the note.

### 2. Teach it to a child

Below the topic, write everything you know about it. But, the trick is to write it plainly and simply — so that a child can understand what you’re talking about.

#### Speak in plain terms

Kids don't understand jargon or complex terminology. _When we speak without jargon, it frees us from hiding behind knowledge we don’t have._ 

#### Brevity

Children don't have the attention span for a winded explanation. They also don’t have the ability — or mental capacity, to understand anything longer than that.

### 3. Identify your knowledge gaps

This is the point where the real learning happens. Identify the areas where you didn't know or explained poorly. What are you missing? What don’t you know?

Highlighting knowledge gaps will help you when you collect and organize your notes into a cohesive story \(which is the next step.\) Now you can call upon your source material \(lecture notes, ideas, etc.\) when you run into questions about how much you do know about your topic.

If you don’t know something, go back to the source material or supporting materials and compile information that will help you fill in the cracks.

### 4. Organize + simplify + Tell a story

Start to tell your story. Piece together your notes and begin to spin a tale using concise explanations. Bring the most vital pieces of your knowledge about the topic together.

Practice reading your story out loud. Pretend to tell the story to a classroom of students. That way, you’ll hear where language stops being simple. Stumbles could indicate incomplete thoughts.

Use analogies and simple sentences to strengthen your understanding of the story. If there are areas that are too technical or complex, try to re-write them in simpler terms. Make sure you can explain it to someone with no knowledge about the subject.

### Draw on Passions

Make connections of your learnings with your passions. It can be music, arts or anything else that you are passionate about.

### Making things Stick

Dedicate a notebook to a place where your knowledge can grow and evolve your ideas and provide inspiration to continue following a path of ongoing learning critical to the fundamentals of deeper, meaningful work.

> “\[He\] opened a fresh notebook. On the title page he wrote: NOTEBOOK OF THINGS I DON’T KNOW ABOUT. For the first but not last time he reorganized his knowledge. He worked for weeks at disassembling each branch of physics, oiling the parts, and putting them back together, looking all the while for the raw edges and inconsistencies. He tried to find the essential kernels of each subject.”

It’s a simple idea: **translate your growing knowledge of something hard into a concrete form and you’re more likely to keep investing the mental energy needed to keep learning.** But sometimes a simple idea is all it takes to unlock a new level of potential.

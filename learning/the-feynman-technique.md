# The Feynman Technique

### **1. Identify the subject**

Write down everything you know about the topic. Each time you run into new sources of information, add them to the note.

### 2. Teach it to a child

Start with a blank note and write the topic or subject you want to teach. Then, below that topic, write everything you know about it. But, the trick is to write it plainly and simply — so that a child can understand what you’re talking about.

#### Speak in plain terms

Kids don't understand jargon or complex terminology. _When we speak without jargon, it frees us from hiding behind knowledge we don’t have._ 

#### Brevity

Children don't have the attention span for a winded explanation. They also don’t have the ability — or mental capacity, to understand anything longer than that.

### 3. Identify your knowledge gaps

This is the point where the real learning happens. What are you missing? What don’t you know?

Highlighting knowledge gaps will help you when you collect and organize your notes into a cohesive story \(which is the next step.\) Now you can call upon your source material \(lecture notes, ideas, etc.\) when you run into questions about how much you do know about your topic.

If you don’t know something, hit the books. Go back to the source material and compile information that will help you fill in the cracks.

### 4. Organize + simplify + Tell a story

Start to tell your story. Piece together your notes and begin to spin a tale using concise explanations. Bring the most vital pieces of your knowledge about the topic together.

Practice reading your story out loud. Pretend to tell the story to a classroom of students. That way, you’ll hear where language stops being simple. Stumbles could indicate incomplete thoughts.

Use analogies and simple sentences to strengthen your understanding of the story.
